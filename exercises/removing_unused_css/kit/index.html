      <section>
        <p>Hey there! If you haven't yet, make sure to run <code>perfschool init</code> <em>before proceeding</em>.</p>
        <p>It will create a <code>perfschool-playground</code> directory with everything you need to get started.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>From time to time, you'll work on a project where you use a CSS framework such as <code>Bootstrap</code>.</p>
        <p>Or, you may be working in a legacy project with tons of CSS that you just <em>know</em> it's not being</p>
        <p>used anymore. In these cases there's a nifty little tool you can use to get rid of all those CSS</p>
        <p>rules that are not being put to good use.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>This saves your users considerable bytes, especially when it comes to including a framework only</p>
        <p>to get access to a couple of the styles they've defined.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The <code>uncss</code> package allows you to get rid of all of those useless bytes by loading a file or URL</p>
        <p>using PhantomJS, a headless browser that's able to interpret resources such as CSS and JavaScript.</p>
      </section>
      <h2 class='header'>PROBLEM</h2>
      <section>
        <p>You are given an application with a bunch of CSS that's used, and a bunch of CSS that's unused.</p>
        <p>Leverage <code>uncss</code> to filter out the unused CSS and only serve what's needed.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Don't inline the styles. Instead, serve a stylesheet in your responses that <em>only</em> has the used</p>
        <p>styles.</p>
