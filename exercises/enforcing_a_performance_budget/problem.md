# INTRODUCTION

Performance budgets are a great way of ensuring a certain level of quality when it comes
to the performance output of your application. An example of a #perfbudget would be to
allocate at most 1MB for tne entire landing page to load, or demand that it results in a
[SpeedIndex](https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/using-webpagetest/metrics/speed-index)
that's not greater than `1000`.

Setting these budgets is a good preventive measure to avoid potential loss of income.
Research shows that gains of as little as 100ms can have a significant impact in
human experience, engagement, and ultimately sales.

Tim Kadlec (@tkadlec) has a few great articles on the topic that I recommend you go through,

Defining a #perfbudget is only half the battle, though. The real benefits come when you
automate and enforce these constraints.
